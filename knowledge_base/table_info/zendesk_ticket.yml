# YAML Configuration for dbt (data build tool) model, or a similar data documentation and transformation tool.
# This file provides an exhaustive and detailed definition of the 'zendesk.ticket' table, based on its DDL.
#
# Table Description:
# The 'zendesk.ticket' table is a comprehensive, denormalized table that stores all information related to customer
# support tickets from the Zendesk platform. It serves as a central repository for ticket data, including metadata,
# content, status, assignments, communication channels, and a vast number of custom fields tailored to the specific
# business processes of the organization (likely a financial services company like Wealthsimple, based on field names).
# The table is designed for analytical querying in a data warehouse environment like Amazon Redshift, as indicated
* by the 'ENCODE' and 'DISTSTYLE' properties.

      # custom field with a similarly inferred description.

      # --- Summary of Custom Field Categories ---
      # 1.  Product-Specific Workflows: Prefixes like `custom_*_invest_`, `custom_*_trade_`, `custom_*_save_`, `custom_*_crypto_`, `custom_*_cash_` indicate workflows tailored to each product line.
      # 2.  Hierarchical Questions: Fields like `custom_what_can_we_help_you_with_` followed by more specific questions like `custom_i_need_help_...` create a decision tree to classify the user's intent.
      # 3.  Internal Process/Routing: Fields like `custom_jira_status`, `custom_legacy_group_assignment`, `custom_risk_ticket_status_` are used for internal tracking, escalations to engineering (Jira), and routing to specialized teams (Risk).
      # 4.  Third-Party Integrations: `custom_five_9_*` fields show data ingested from a Five9 call center system. `custom_ada_conversation_id` suggests integration with an Ada chatbot.
      # 5.  Surveys and Feedback: `custom_csat_`, `custom_ces_`, `custom_csat_comments` store customer satisfaction and effort score feedback.
      # 6.  Machine Learning Predictions: `custom_a_i_prediction`, `custom_predicted_topic`, `custom_predicted_subtopic` are likely populated by an AI model to auto-classify tickets.
      # 7.  Booleans for Flags: `custom_vip_client`, `custom_social_media_priority`, `custom_bpo_escalated_` are simple flags to denote special handling rules.
      # 8.  Timestamps and Numeric Values: `custom_next_promised_update` (date), `custom_internal_priority` (bigint), `custom_total_time_spent_sec_` (bigint) capture specific metrics.

      # --- Diverse Examples of Other Custom Fields ---
